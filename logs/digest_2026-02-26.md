  Topic: [BUG] Redis connection instability in `connection.js`

  r/node
  Dealing with unreliable Redis connections in connection.js?
  
  Working on a Node.js project, I kept running into issues where Redis connections would fail silently in `connection.js`, causing user-facing errors and occasional downtime. The default setup seemed fragile under network hiccups or Redis restarts.
  
  I ended up writing a small, standalone function to replace the connection logic with proper retry mechanisms, timeout handling, and reconnection. It's just a simple drop-in replacement, not a full library.
  
  Is this a common problem? How have others handled Redis connection stability in their projects? I'm curious if this small utility would be useful, or if there are better approaches I should consider. Happy to share the code if it's helpful.

  Show HN: A robust drop-in replacement function for Redis connection.js
  
  I kept hitting Redis connection instability in a project - the standard `connection.js` would fail silently and bring down parts of the app. Got tired of patching it, so I built a small, focused function that handles retries, timeouts, and reconnection logic.
  
  It's essentially just one improved function you can swap in. No framework, no dependencies. Since this seems like a common pain point, I'm sharing it here.
  
  Would love feedback: Is this something others struggle with? Does the approach make sense? What edge cases am I missing?

  Topic: Ask HN: Is there a better way to document complex softw

  r/devops
  Anyone else frustrated with keeping software architecture docs updated?
  
  I'm a senior engineer working on a tool to auto-generate architecture diagrams from codebases. At my company, we have 50+ microservices and our Confluence docs are always outdated the moment they're written.
  
  The tool I'm building scans your code, maps out dependencies between services/modules, and creates an interactive diagram. It's command-line based and exports to a simple web viewer.
  
  I'm not trying to sell anything - this is just a side project. Curious if others face this problem and what you've tried:
  - Do your teams struggle with documentation drift?
  - Have you found any tools that actually work for keeping architectural docs in sync?
  - What would your ideal solution look like?
  
  If you're interested in testing an early version, DM me. Mostly looking for feedback on whether this approach would actually help engineering teams.
